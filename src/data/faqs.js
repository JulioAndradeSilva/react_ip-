    description: `The free version of Falcon is available for teams of up to 15 people. Our Falcon Premium plans of 15 or fewer qualify for a small team discount.

The price of a paid Falcon plan is tiered, starting in groups of 5 and 10 users, based on the number of people you have in your Team or Organization.`
